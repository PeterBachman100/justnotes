			<div class="text-block">
				<p>Building habits and creating positive change can be easy if you have the right approach. Don't rely on motivation and willpower. The only consistent, sustainable way to grow big is to start small and use incremental progress.</p>
				<h3 class="call-out">You change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad.</h3><p>With Tiny Habits, you celebrate even the smallest successes. This takes advantage of our neurochemistry and quickly turns deliberate actions into automatic habits.</p><p>The essence of tiny habits is this: take a behavior you want, make it tiny, find where it fits naturally in your life, and nurture it's growth. Focus on small actions that you can do in less than thirty seconds. Feeling successful helps us quickly wire in new habits, lets them grow naturally, and motivates us to do more.</p><p>To be successful in changing your habits: <ol><li>Stop judging yourself</li><li>Take you aspirations and break them down into tiny behaviors</li><li>Celebrate even the smallest successes</li><li>Embrace your mistakes as discoveries and use them to move forward</li></ol></p>

					<p>A Behavior will happen if both Motivation and Ability are high enough when the Prompt occurs. When a behavior is prompted above the Action Line, it happens. Behaviors that ultimately become habits will reliably fall above the Action Line.</p>
					<h3 class="call-out">Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt</h3>
					<p>When motivation is high, people can do very difficult things. When ability is high, people will do behaviors even with very low motivation. Without a prompt, something you are very motivated and capable of doing won't happen.</p>

			<h1>Steps in Behavior Design</h1>
			<section id="4" class="scroll-mg-tp main-section">
				<span class="step">1 / 7</span>
				<h2>Clarify The Aspiration</h2>
				<h3>Motivation toward an abstraction doesn't yield results</h3>
				<p>Millions of people genuinely aspire to live healthier, live stressful, and more fulfilling lives. The problem is that people try to motivate themselves toward an aspiration. So people focus on aspirations and motivation, but that combo doesn't produce results. Investing time and energy to motivate ourselves toward an abstraction is the wrong move.</p>
				<p>People don't naturally think in terms of specific behaviors. Aspirations are abstract desires, like wanting your kids to succeed in school. Outcomes are more measurable, like getting straight As second semester. Both of these are great places to start the process of Behavior Design. But aspirations and outcomes are not behaviors. Here’s an easy way to differentiate behaviors from aspirations and outcomes: A behavior is something you can do right now or at another specific point in time. You can turn off your phone. You can eat a carrot. You can open a textbook and read five pages. These are actions that you can do at any given moment. In contrast, you can’t achieve an aspiration or outcome at any given moment. You cannot suddenly get better sleep.</p>
				<h3>What do you want? What is your dream? What result do you want to achieve?</h3>
				<p>Getting clear on your aspiration allows you to design efficiently for what you really want. You might assume your aspiration is to be more mindful. But when you think about this, you decide that what you really want is to reduce stress in your life. And reducing stress will be easier than being more mindful. You could take a daily walk outside, play a musical instrument for ten minutes, or cut back on watching TV news. In this step, revise your aspiration or outcome so it taps into what really matters to you.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="5" class=" scroll-mg-tp main-section">
				<span class="step">2 / 7</span>
				<h2>Explore Behavior Options</h2>
				<p>Come up with a bunch of specific behaviors that can help you achieve your aspiration. You are not making any decisions or commitments in this step. You are exploring your options. The more behaviors you list, the better. You can tap into your creativity or maybe ask friends for their ideas.</p>
				<h3>Magic Wanding</h3>
				<p>When guiding people in this process, I like to remind them that for now they have magical powers. They can get themselves to do any behavior.</p>
				<h4 class="call-out">It’s important to explore in this step—and be wildly optimistic.</h4>
				<p>I call this method Magic Wanding. Even with a magic wand in hand and my encouraging them to use those superpowers, people sometimes wish for practical behaviors (which is fine). Some wishes are behaviors you do one time: download a meditation app. Some wishes are for new habits: stretching for two minutes after every conference call. And some wishes are to stop doing a behavior: stop checking e-mail after seven p.m. To generate lots of behavior options, you can use the following categories during your own Magic Wanding sessions. What behaviors would you do one time? What new habits would you create? What habit would you stop? After you come up with each behavior wish, think to yourself, Great. What else? and keep going.</p>
				<p>Look over your behavior wishes and try to make each one more specific. If you’ve written down “play with my dog” as a way to reduce stress, you could make that wish more specific by revising it to this: “Play fetch with my dog each evening at home.” After you revise your behavior wishes to be super specific (what I call “crispy”), move on to the next step in the Behavior Design process and get analytical and practical.</p>

				<span class="step">3 / 7</span>
				<h2>Match with Specific Behaviors</h2>
				<p>One big difference in Behavior Design versus other approaches is that with my methods you focus on habits you already have motivation to do. You don’t pick a habit and try to bolt on motivation later. In Behavior Design, motivation is already embedded in the new habit. In other approaches you will struggle to maintain a habit you think you should do. An important part of lasting change is matching yourself to behaviors you want to do, not just think you should do. We should be dreamy about our aspirations, but not about the behaviors that get us there.</p><h4 class="call-out">The key question is: "Can I get myself to do this?"</h4>
				<h3>In Behavior Design we have a name for the best matches: Golden Behaviors.</h3>
				<div class="small-cards-wrap">
					<div class="small-card secondary-bg">
						<h4 class="center">A Golden Behavior has three criteria:</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>The behavior is effective in realizing your aspiration (impact)</li>
							<li>You want to do the behavior (motivation)</li>
							<li>You can do the behavior (ability)</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div class="small-card">
						<p>In Behavior Design we match ourselves with new habits we can do even when we are at our most hurried, unmotivated, and beautifully imperfect. If you can imagine yourself doing the behavior on your hardest day of the week, it’s probably a good match. It’s probably a Golden Behavior.</p>
					</div>

				<div class="small-cards-wrap">

						<h3 class="center">Focus Mapping</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Write each behavior on a card of small piece of paper.</li>
							<li>Sort the behavior cards up and down along the impact dimension. Don't think about feasibility. Focus on the impact that the behaviors could have.</li>
							<li>Slide the behavior cards side to side along the feasibility dimension. Be realistic. Can you really get yourself to do these behaviors?</li>
							<li>Look in the upper right-hand corner. These are your Golden Behaviors.</li>

				<h2>Start Tiny</h2>
				<h4 class="call-out">When you design a new habit, you are designing for consistency, for which simplicity is key. By going tiny, you create consistency, which makes sure the habit sticks.</h4>
				<p>When you are designing a new habit, you are really designing for consistency. And for that result, you’ll find that simplicity is the key. Or as I like to teach my students: Simplicity changes behavior. If you want to do a habit consistently, you’ve got to adjust the most reliable thing in the B=MAP model—ability. That’s where we have the most power to stack the deck in our favor. If a behavior is hard, make it easier to do. You’ll see that over time your motivation will vary, but your ability will improve the more you do your new habit. And that increase in ability helps your habit grow. Regardless of what your aspiration is, increasing your skills, getting tools and resources, and making the behavior tiny are what makes things easier to do.</p>

				<h2>Find a Good Prompt</h2>
				<p>Prompts can be based off personal, internal cues (you feel hungry), external cues (a sticky note or alarm), or based off actions (your feet hit the floor after waking up). Action-based prompts are by far the most reliable. These are called Anchor Moments, or Anchors for short.</p>
				<p>When using Anchors, try to find something that defines a precise, final moment of the action, called the Trailing Edge. For example, the Trailing Edge of brushing my teeth is putting my toothbrush back in the holder. Using the Trailing Edge of an Anchor is much more reliable than using the general moment.</p>
				<h3 class="call-out">For the best results, the Anchor (Prompt) and Behavior should have the same Location, Theme/Purpose, and Frequency.</h3>
				<p>The habit recipe: "After I sit down for work, I will change my car oil" will almost certainly fail because the location, frequency, and theme don't match.</p>
				<div class="small-cards-wrap">
					<div class="small-card secondary-bg shadow">
						<h3 class="expandable-header">Location</h3>
						<p class="expandable-content">The anchor and behavior need to happen in the same physical location. The more precise the better. Doing both things at the same desk will work better than doing both in the same room, or same building.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="small-card secondary-bg shadow">
						<h3 class="expandable-header">Frequency</h3>
						<p class="expandable-content">If you want to do something 4 times a day, match it with an anchor that happens 4 times a day.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="small-card secondary-bg shadow">
						<h3 class="expandable-header">Theme/Purpose</h3>
						<p class="expandable-content">For the best results, match productivity behaviors with productivity anchors, relaxing behaviors with relaxing anchors, etc.</p>
					</div>		
				</div>
				<p>You can also use irritants and in-between times in your life as prompts for behaviors as well, such as hearing your coworker complain, or waiting in line. These are respectively called Pearl and Meanwhile habits.</p>

			<section id="9" class=" scroll-mg-tp main-section">
				<span class="step">6 / 7</span>
				<h2>Celebrate Successes</h2>
				<p>Feeling good is a vital part of the Tiny Habits method. You can create this good feeling by using a technique I call celebration. When you celebrate in the Tiny Habits way, you create a positive feeling inside yourself on demand. This good feeling wires the new habit into your brain. You’ll find that celebration is surprisingly effective, and it can be quick and easy, even fun.</p>
				<h3 class="call-out">Emotions Create Habits</h3>
				<p>When you celebrate effectively, you tap into the reward circuitry of your brain. By feeling good at the right moment, you cause your brain to recognize and encode the sequence of behaviors you just performed. In other words, you can hack your brain to create a habit by celebrating and self-reinforcing.</p>
				<p>There is a direct connection between what you feel when you do a behavior and the likelihood that you will repeat the behavior in the future. Habits can form very quickly, often in just a few days, as long as people have a strong positive emotion connected to the behavior. In fact, some habits seem to get wired in immediately: You do the behavior once, and then you don’t consider other options again.</p><p>Conversely, if a behavior is painful, awkward, or unpleasant, your brain will rewire to start avoiding that habit. To keep a habit alive, celebrate extra when it is uncomfortable.</p>
				<p>Search for celebrations that feel authentic to you. If you feel awkward or phony when celebrating, your attempts will backfire. Your brain doesn’t want to feel awkward—it wants to feel good. Celebrations are personal. What makes me feel good (and not lame) is probably different than what makes you feel good (and not lame).</p>
				<div>
					<h3 class="call-out">
						It doesn’t matter whether your celebration is an explosive anthem or a silent focus on your life’s purpose. What matters is that your celebration creates the internal feeling of success.
					</h3>	
				</div>
				<p>For the sake of simplicity, I tell people to celebrate immediately after they do a behavior. But the truth is, you can build habits faster and more reliably by celebrating at three different times: the moment you remember to do the habit, when you’re doing the habit, and immediately after completing the habit.</p>
				<div class="secondary-bg small-card">
					<h3 class="expandable-header">Example Celebrations</h3>
					<ul class="expandable-content">

							<p>When you apply the Tiny Habits method consistently, your habits will scale naturally.</p>

When you feel successful at something, even if it’s tiny, your confidence grows quickly, and your motivation increases to do that habit again and perform related behaviors.
							</p>
							<p>I call this success momentum. Surprisingly enough, this gets created by the frequency of your successes, not by the size. So with Tiny Habits you are shooting for a bunch of tiny successes done quickly. Not a big one that takes a long time.
							</p>
							<p>When people feel successful, even with small things, their overall level of motivation goes up dramatically, and with higher levels of motivation, people can do harder behaviors. This is how tiny successes can change the game for you at work, at home, and even inside your own head.

		<h2>Untangling Bad Habits</h2>
		<h3 class="call-out">Use everything you learned about making habits easier in reverse.</h3>
		<p>When it comes to stopping a bad habit, a common mistake is trying to motivate yourself toward an abstraction, such as “stop stressing out at work” or “stop eating junk food.” Those both sound specific, but they are not. They are abstract labels for a tangle of habits, what I call the General Habit. If you focus only on the General Habit, you probably won’t make much progress, just like if you focus on the entire knot at once, you can’t untangle it. You need to focus on specific tangles in order to make progress. That means finding specific habits to focus on.</p>
		<div class="small-card grey-bg">
			<p>Use the Swarm of Behaviors cloud from earlier to help clarify the particular behaviors that are part of your bad habit:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Write the general bad behavior in the cloud</li>
				<li>Write specific behaviors around it</li>
			</ol>
