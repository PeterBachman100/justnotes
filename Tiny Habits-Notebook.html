Stop judging yourself . Take your aspirations and break them down into tiny behaviors . Embrace mistakes as discoveries and use them to move forward .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 4 &middot; Location 102</div><div class='noteText'>I’ve found that there are only three things we can do that will create lasting change : Have an epiphany , change our environment , or change our habits in tiny ways .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 5 &middot; Location 109</div><div class='noteText'>The essence of Tiny Habits is this : Take a behavior you want , make it tiny , find where it fits naturally in your life , and nurture its growth .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 5 &middot; Location 116</div><div class='noteText'>With the Tiny Habits method , you focus on small actions that you can do in less than thirty seconds .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 176</div><div class='noteText'>A change myth was holding Amy back — the pervasive idea that you’ve got to go big or go home . We live in an aspiration - driven culture that is rooted in instant gratification . We find it difficult to enact or even accept incremental progress . Which is exactly what you need to cultivate meaningful long - term change .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 205</div><div class='noteText'>the idea that stopping a habit is a matter of willpower couldn’t have been further from the truth .</h3>

ANCHOR MOMENT An existing routine ( like brushing your teeth ) or an event that happens ( like a phone ringing ) . The Anchor Moment reminds you to do the new Tiny Behavior . 2 . NEW TINY BEHAVIOR A simple version of the new habit you want , such as flossing one tooth or doing two push - ups . You do the Tiny Behavior immediately after the Anchor Moment . 3 . INSTANT CELEBRATION Something you do to create positive emotions , such as saying , “ I did a good job ! ” You celebrate immediately after doing the new Tiny Behavior .

Step 2 : Tape the paper to your bathroom mirror or anywhere you will frequently see it . Step 3 : Read the phrase often .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>The Elements of Behavior</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 456</div><div class='noteText'>If you don’t have a prompt , your levels of motivation and ability don’t matter . Either you are prompted to act or you’re not . No prompt , no behavior . Simple yet powerful .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 460</div><div class='noteText'>You can disrupt a behavior you don’t want by removing the prompt . This isn’t always easy , but removing the prompt is your best first move to stop a behavior from happening .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 30 &middot; Location 484</div><div class='noteText'></h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 33 &middot; Location 546</div><div class='noteText'>You don’t start with motivation when you troubleshoot . You follow these steps instead . Try each step in order . If you don’t get results , move to the next step . Check to see if there’s a prompt to do the behavior . See if the person has the ability to do the behavior . See if the person is motivated to do the behavior .</h3>

If the result wasn’t to her liking , she needed to change the ratios and fiddle with the ingredients , not beat herself up or give up .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Motivation—Focus on Matching</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 42 &middot; Location 680</div><div class='noteText'>most people think you can create whatever habits you want if you find the right carrot to dangle in front of yourself . This kind of thinking is understandable , but it also happens to be wrong .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 44 &middot; Location 706</div><div class='noteText'>competing motivations were driving them toward different behaviors .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 44 &middot; Location 708</div><div class='noteText'>conflicting motivations , which are opposing drives related to the same behavior .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 46 &middot; Location 734</div><div class='noteText'>you got caught in a common trap of the human mind — you overestimated future motivation . It happens to the best of us . You are not dumb or frivolous or easily hoodwinked . You are human .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 48 &middot; Location 749</div><div class='noteText'>Willpower decreases from morning to evening . Complex decisions get harder by late in the day . Motivation for self - improvement can vanish on Friday nights . These shifts are among the reasons why you cannot take full control of your motivation .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 50 &middot; Location 803</div><div class='noteText'>Aspirations are abstract desires , like wanting your kids to succeed in school . Outcomes are more measurable , like getting straight As second semester . Both of these are great places to start the process of Behavior Design . But aspirations and outcomes are not behaviors . Here’s an easy way to differentiate behaviors from aspirations and outcomes : A behavior is something you can do right now or at another specific point in time .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 51 &middot; Location 809</div><div class='noteText'>people don’t naturally think in terms of specific behaviors , and this tendency trips up almost everyone .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 52 &middot; Location 835</div><div class='noteText'>The first step in Behavior Design is to get clear on your aspirations ( or outcomes ) . What do you want ? What is your dream ? What result do you want to achieve ? Write down your aspirations or outcomes and consider whatever you write as something you will probably revise .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 52 &middot; Location 840</div><div class='noteText'>Getting clear on your aspiration allows you to design efficiently for what you really want . You might assume your aspiration is to be more mindful . But when you think about this , you decide that what you really want is to reduce stress in your life . And reducing stress will be easier than being more mindful . You could take a daily walk outside , play a musical instrument for ten minutes , or cut back on watching TV news . In this step , revise your aspiration or outcome so it taps into what really matters to you . ( A</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 53 &middot; Location 851</div><div class='noteText'>You get down to specifics in step 2 . You select one of your aspirations , then come up with a bunch of specific behaviors that can help you achieve your aspiration .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 53 &middot; Location 852</div><div class='noteText'>You are not making any decisions or commitments in this step . You are exploring your options . The more behaviors you list , the better .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 54 &middot; Location 867</div><div class='noteText'>To generate lots of behavior options , you can use the following categories during your own Magic Wanding sessions . What behaviors would you do one time ? What new habits would you create ? What habit would you stop ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 56 &middot; Location 884</div><div class='noteText'>look over your behavior wishes and try to make each one more specific . If you’ve written down “ play with my dog ” as a way to reduce stress , you could make that wish more specific by revising it to this : “ Play fetch with my dog each evening at home . ” After you revise your behavior wishes to be super specific ( what I call “ crispy ” ) , move on to the next step in the Behavior Design process and get analytical and practical .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 58 &middot; Location 920</div><div class='noteText'>All of these approaches involve guessing and chance . And that’s not a good way to design for change in your life . Having systematic criteria for how to choose behaviors for yourself will make you effective in getting results , and the next step in Behavior Design will save you from guessing .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 58 &middot; Location 931</div><div class='noteText'>In this step , you will match yourself with specific behaviors , and there’s no guessing in this systematic approach .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 58 &middot; Location 934</div><div class='noteText'>In Behavior Design we have a name for the best matches : Golden Behaviors . A Golden Behavior has three criteria .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 58 &middot; Location 935</div><div class='noteText'>The behavior is effective in realizing your aspiration ( impact ) You want to do the behavior ( motivation ) You can do the behavior ( ability )</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 941</div><div class='noteText'>Doing a Focus Map should take you less than ten minutes start to finish . At the end , you’ll have two or three behaviors that rise to the top . Those are your Golden Behaviors . And that’s what you design for while setting aside all the other options . A Golden Behavior can be a one - time action . Canceling your cable subscription is a task done one time that will probably lead to watching TV less . Other Golden Behaviors will be habits you repeat day after day , such as charging your phone in the kitchen instead of next to your bed .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 60 &middot; Location 950</div><div class='noteText'></h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 60 &middot; Location 967</div><div class='noteText'>In this round you focus on feasibility and practicality . You become the real you , not the fantasy version . In round two you don’t move cards up or down ; you slide them side to side along the feasibility dimension . Mark eyes his guitar - playing and work - leaving behaviors and asks himself : Can I get myself to do this ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 61 &middot; Location 984</div><div class='noteText'>A key to lasting change is matching yourself with behaviors that you want to do . In your quest to exercise daily , for example , you’ll find plenty of options . If streaming Beyoncé and dancing for five minutes while you make breakfast is the exercise you want to do , then make dancing a daily habit . And forget about the treadmill at the gym .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 62 &middot; Location 991</div><div class='noteText'>Fogg Maxim # 1 : Help people do what they already want to do .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 62 &middot; Location 1001</div><div class='noteText'>The purpose of a Focus Map is to match yourself with easy behaviors that you want to do and that are effective in getting you to your aspiration . When you start with the easiest , most motivating thing , you can ladder up naturally to bigger behaviors — perhaps eventually eating blueberries in your oatmeal .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 62 &middot; Location 1003</div><div class='noteText'>In Behavior Design we match ourselves with new habits we can do even when we are at our most hurried , unmotivated , and beautifully imperfect . If you can imagine yourself doing the behavior on your hardest day of the week , it’s probably a good match .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 64 &middot; Location 1034</div><div class='noteText'>The last step in the Focus Mapping method is to select which behaviors you will design for . What’s in and what’s out ? You will almost always select a handful of behaviors that are in the upper - right corner . You design for these Golden Behaviors , and you forget the rest .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 66 &middot; Location 1050</div><div class='noteText'>when you’re done sorting your Focus Map , you’ll look at the Golden Behaviors and feel optimistic and energized . What you want to do and what you can do will converge into what you most likely will do , and that’s the most fertile ground for growing habits .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 66 &middot; Location 1052</div><div class='noteText'>think about their new habits as small seeds . If you plant a good seed in the right spot , it will grow without coaxing . Starting with behaviors that you can and want to do makes for a good seed . Choosing behaviors that set you up for success increases your confidence and mastery as you go , thus increasing your natural motivation to do bigger and bigger behaviors</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 66 &middot; Location 1054</div><div class='noteText'>it all starts small and honest and specific . We should be dreamy about aspirations but not about the behaviors that will get us there . Behaviors are grounded . Concrete . They are the handholds and footholds that get you up the rock face . Your path to the top is your own , and you choose your behaviors according to the particular rock you are climbing . Matching yourself with the right behaviors is the most critical step in the Behavior Design process and an important place to return to when troubleshooting .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 66 &middot; Location 1065</div><div class='noteText'>To review : Clarify your aspiration or outcome , generate a big set of behavior options , and match yourself with specific Golden Behaviors .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 70 &middot; Location 1092</div><div class='noteText'>Pick your own aspiration this time and use Focus Mapping ( not stars and circles ) to match yourself with the Golden Behaviors . Step 1 : Draw a cloud on a piece of paper . Step 2 : Write your aspiration inside the cloud . ( If you can’t think of anything , write “ Reduce my stress . ” ) Step 3 : Come up with ten or more behaviors that would lead you to your aspiration . Write each behavior outside the cloud with arrows pointing toward the cloud . Step 4 : Write each of the ten behaviors on a card or a small piece of paper . This is the first step in using Focus Mapping . Step 5 : Sort the behavior cards up and down along the impact dimension . Don’t think about feasibility . Focus on the impact that the behaviors could have . ( For guidance , refer to the Focus Mapping graphic a few pages back . )</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 70 &middot; Location 1103</div><div class='noteText'>Step 6 : Slide the behavior cards side to side along the feasibility dimension . Be realistic . Can you really get yourself to do these behaviors ? Step 7 : Look in the upper right - hand corner . Those are your Golden Behaviors . ( If nothing is in this corner , go back to Step 3 . ) Step 8 : Design a way to make your Golden Behaviors a reality in your life using your intuition for now . I’ll share a systematic way to do this in a later chapter .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 77 &middot; Location 1225</div><div class='noteText'>When you are designing a new habit , you are really designing for consistency . And for that result , you’ll find that simplicity is the key . Or as I like to teach my students : Simplicity changes behavior .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 86 &middot; Location 1376</div><div class='noteText'>That Starter Step becomes your Tiny Behavior and the only action you need to do at the start of your new habit .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 86 &middot; Location 1381</div><div class='noteText'>Do not raise the bar prematurely . Don’t rush to make the behavior bigger . It’s always okay to not walk after putting on your shoes if that’s all you want to do for the day . By keeping the bar low , you keep the habit alive . You’ll ensure that you’re always capable of doing the behavior no matter how your motivation fluctuates .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 87 &middot; Location 1392</div><div class='noteText'>The Starter Step is a kind of mental jujitsu — it has a surprising impact for such a small move because the momentum it creates often propels you to the next steps with less friction . The key is not to raise the bar . Doing the Starter Step is success . Every time you do it , you are keeping that habit alive and cultivating the possibility of growth .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 88 &middot; Location 1408</div><div class='noteText'>Scaling Back . This means taking the behavior you want and shrinking it . As a result , your Tiny Habit will be a much smaller version of your desired behavior . Consider my flossing habit : I wanted to floss all my teeth but began with just one . I scaled it back . If your desired behavior is to walk a mile every day , you can scale back by walking to the mailbox . Nothing more . As with the Starter Step , the scaled - back version is your Tiny Habit — it’s your baseline behavior , the only thing you have to do every day to cultivate the walking habit that will eventually grow to full size .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 88 &middot; Location 1424</div><div class='noteText'>Take your Golden Behaviors from chapter 3 and see if you can make them tiny . Find a Starter Step or scale back — either way is fine .</h3>

Fantastic . You’re done . You can start practicing your new habit . No ? Next question . Can you find a Starter Step for your behavior ? Yes ? Great . Make the Starter Step your initial habit , then do more later when you feel like it . No ? Uh - oh . If you said no to all of these questions , you might need to go back and match yourself with a different behavior from your Swarm of Behaviors .</h3>

Think of it this way : You can keep many tiny plants alive by giving them a few drops of water a day . It’s the same with habits .</h3>

That’s what you’ll explore in this exercise . You’ll try to create six habits at once as a way to discover your capacity for creating multiple habits at a time . Step 1 : Create six recipes for new habits using what you’ve learned so far in this book . You can also get inspiration from the appendix “ Three Hundred Recipes for Tiny Habits . ” Step 2 : Write each recipe on an index card or use my template found at TinyHabits.com / recipecards . Step 3 : For each recipe , make sure the behavior is tiny . If it’s not tiny enough , then scale it back . Step 4 : For each recipe , make sure the Anchor is specific . Bonus : Identify the Trailing Edge of each Anchor . Step 5 : Practice these six new habits for one week , revising and rehearsing as needed . ( If you don’t like a new habit , discard it and add something else . ) Step 6 : After a week , reflect on what you’ve learned about yourself and the Tiny Habits method . As you move forward , keep the new habits you like most , and let the others fade . To do well on this exercise , you’ll need to redesign your environment and rehearse , which are the focus of the next two exercises . EXERCISE # 3 : PRACTICE A CONTEXT SKILL In this exercise , you will practice the Context Skill of redesigning your environment to support the change you want in your life . Step 1 : Look at each new habit recipe from the Behavior Crafting exercise . Step 2 : For each habit , find ways to redesign your environment so that each one is easier to do .</h3>

Here is an exercise for doing that . Step 1 : Look at the six recipes you’ve created for Tiny Habits . Step 2 : For each one , do the Anchor behavior and the new habit . Step 3 : Celebrate as you do the new habit or immediately afterward . Step 4 : Repeat this behavior sequence seven to ten times . Step 5 : Try not to feel too strange doing the habit rehearsal . Remember how top performances in sports , business presentations , and more comes from practice . And that’s how you get top performance in behavior change . EXERCISE # 5 : PRACTICE A MINDSET SKILL One important Mindset Skill is being okay with doing only the tiny behavior . It’s okay to floss only one tooth or do only two push - ups . Here’s an exercise that will help you get comfortable with this concept . Step 1 : Pick any new habit you are doing regularly . ( If you don’t have one , then select flossing your teeth . ) Step 2 : When you do the new habit next time , do only the tiniest version on purpose . Resist the temptation to do more . Step 3 : Congratulate yourself for deliberately keeping it tiny and feeling okay with that . Step 4 : Repeat this for at least three days in order to develop a mindset that even the tiniest of changes is good . ( You want to feel good about underperforming on the size of a habit because that is how you overachieve in doing habits consistently . ) EXERCISE # 6 : PRACTICE A SELF - INSIGHT SKILL One important Self - Insight Skill is finding the smallest changes in your life that will have the biggest meaning . I believe this exercise is the toughest one I’ve suggested , and that’s why I saved it for last . Step 1 : List an area of life that really matters to you , such as being a good mom or showing compassion . Step 2 : Spend three minutes thinking about the simplest one - time behaviors you could do that would have significant meaning in that area . Make a list . Step 3 : Repeat step 2 , but this time consider the tiniest new habits that would have the most significance to you in that area . Make a list . Extra credit : Decide what items from steps 2 and 3 you want to put into practice .</h3>
